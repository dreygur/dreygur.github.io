Building scalable APIs is one of the most critical skills for backend developers. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore how to create production-ready REST APIs using Node.js and Express that can handle millions of requests.

## Why Node.js for APIs?

Node.js has become the go-to choice for building APIs due to its non-blocking I/O model and event-driven architecture. This makes it perfect for handling concurrent requests efficiently. Companies like Netflix, LinkedIn, and PayPal have successfully migrated to Node.js, seeing significant performance improvements.

## Essential Patterns for Scalability

When building scalable APIs, you need to consider several key patterns:

```javascript
// Example: Rate Limiting Middleware
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
});

app.use('/api/', limiter);
```

## Caching Strategies

Implementing proper caching can dramatically reduce your database load and improve response times. Use Redis for session storage and frequently accessed data. Consider CDN caching for static assets and API responses that don't change frequently.

## Database Optimization

Your database is often the bottleneck. Use connection pooling, implement proper indexing, and consider read replicas for heavy read operations. For write-heavy applications, look into sharding strategies.

```javascript
// Example: Connection Pooling with PostgreSQL
const { Pool } = require('pg');

const pool = new Pool({
  max: 20,
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000,
});

module.exports = {
  query: (text, params) => pool.query(text, params)
};
```

## Monitoring and Logging

You can't improve what you don't measure. Implement comprehensive logging with structured formats, use APM tools like New Relic or DataDog, and set up alerts for critical metrics like response time and error rates.

## Conclusion

Building scalable APIs is an iterative process. Start with solid foundations, measure everything, and optimize based on real-world data. The patterns covered here will help you build APIs that can grow with your application's needs.
