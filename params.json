It will notify user about charging, discharging and not charging state of the battery on Linux (Surely if battery is present).\r\n\r\n### **[Easy LEMP](http://lab.maateen.me/easy-lemp)**\r\n\r\nEasy-LEMP is a Python3 script. EasyLEMP will help you to install LEMP (Nginx, PHP-FPM, MariaDB) on Linux along with phpMyAdmin with just four commands. Currently it only supports Ubuntu Desktop Edition. Support for Ubuntu Server Edition is now under development. Please, try to contribute if you can.\r\n\r\n### **[Gedit Material Theme](http://lab.maateen.me/gedit-material-theme/)**\r\n\r\nA fork of [Gedit Material Theme](https://github.com/radel/gedit-material-theme) by [Marco Bonomo](https://github.com/radel) which was a clone of Sublime Text Material theme by [Mattia Astorino](http://equinsuocha.io/).\r\n\r\n### **[Mama](http://lab.maateen.me/mama/)**\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to let you use [Microsoft powered Bing Speech Recognition API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/speech-api) to control your Linux computer. The project is developed in Python3. For note, this is a fork of project [google2ubuntu](https://github.com/benoitfragit/google2ubuntu).  \r\n\r\nThe mother project, [google2ubuntu](https://github.com/benoitfragit/google2ubuntu), is a tool that **Franquet Benoit** started 2 years ago, written in Python2. Unfortunately, he was not able to do what he wanted because of a lack of time. Perhaps, he used Google Web Speech API which isn't free anymore. \r\n\r\nSo I am moving the project to the next level using [Microsoft powered Bing Speech Recognition API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/speech-api) by renaming it to **Mama**.\r\n\r\n### **[Nipy](http://lab.maateen.me/nipy)**\r\n\r\nNipy is a Python3 blog engine based on Flask micro framework. I was thinking to make a full-functional Blog engine like Wordpress but unfortunately I am shutting down this project due to some personal issues. If you feel happy to take this project to the next level, you're most welcome. I lost the main project due to a Hard-Drive lost. I have gained this one from my bitbucket, has a lots of bugs. Please fix them, I have fixed them almost all of them but lost due to a unwanted HDD fail. Also, in this project, I have done less comment, actually trying to make my code readable even without comment. Don't know I have passed or failed.\r\n\r\n### **[Py URL Shortener](http://lab.maateen.me/py-url-shortener)**\r\n\r\nPy-URL-Shortener is a Python powered Flask app implementing a technique in which a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) has been made substantially shorter in length and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a redirect on a domain name that is short, which links to the web page that has a long URL.\r\n\r\n### **[Wordpress Bangla Pack](http://lab.maateen.me/wordpress-bangla-pack)**\r\n\r\nWordpress Bangla Pack is a simple, smart & easy plugin by which you can localize your Wordpress site in Bangla. It means that your whole site will appear in Bangla. Here I have used the best translation of each phrases & sentences to provide the best plugin to its users. If you ever think about a plugin to translate your Wordpress site in Bangla, you should not choose any other way except Wordpress Bangla Pack. Happy Blogging!!!\r\n\r\n# My Contributions\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n### **[Avro](http://lab.maateen.me/avro/)**\r\n\r\nAvro phonetic implementation for Linux in IBus.

It is inspired by the django-admin package, but implemented in such a way that the developer has total control of the look, feel and functionality of the resulting application.\r\n\r\n### **[Mezzanine](https://github.com/stephenmcd/mezzanine)**\r\n\r\nMezzanine is a powerful, consistent, and flexible content management platform.

Uses [Rofi](https://davedavenport.github.io/rofi/) for a simple popup menu. Uses the [English Open Word List](http://dreamsteep.com/projects/the-english-open-word-list.html) for a basic English dictionary, plus a Bangla dictionary ported from [ibus-avro](https:github.com/sarim/ibus-avro).
